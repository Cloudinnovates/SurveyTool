## Known deficiencies or possible improvements
- Can only drag in or sort. Need to be able to do both
- CSS everywhere
- Having to use !important on a - Ability to put question labels and controls on separate lines. Question      above and fields belowCSS rule to override the default cursor rule instituted by ng2-dnd package
- Needs some serious refactoring
- The hacky way I am adding question options and ratings to radio, checkbox, and grid type questions
- Add preview link to see survey on its own page (good way to get Angular routing in use on this project)
- Allow user to exclude parts of address field and customize placeholder for each field
- Allow user to remove options/ratings from multi-select type fields
- Refine order of question style settings so that they are all consistent and make sense
- Color pickers instead of hex strings
- Paddding setting split into 4 fields rather than string
- Border setting split out into 3 fields rather than string
- Button needs a font size settings field
- Paragraph element needs to respect line breaks and perhaps have a very basic rich text editor implemented
- Required attribute for checkboxes doesn't work the same as radio buttons in that for radio buttons for any   set of buttons with the same name attribute, if any one of them is checked the required is fulfilled. For    checkboxes, the required attribute is on a per checkbox basis ,so validation has to be done with JS to get   the same type of experience
- Add Firebase back end?
