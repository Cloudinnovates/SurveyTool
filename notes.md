## Known deficiencies or possible improvements
The hacky way I am adding question options and ratings to radio, checkbox, and grid type questions
CSS everywhere
Needs some serious refactoring
Having to use !important on a CSS rule to override the default cursor rule instituted by ng2-dnd package
Ability to put question labels and controls on separate lines. Question above and fields below
If user includes an email address, include email address validation in the exported code
Add preview link to see survey on its own page (good way to get Angular routing in use on this project)
Allow user to exclude parts of address field and customize placeholder for each field
Allow user to remove options/ratings from multi-select type fields
