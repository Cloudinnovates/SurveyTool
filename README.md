# Survey Tool

This Survey Tool project started as an attempt to clone the functionality of the online survey making webapp Jotform. Users can create
surveys, add multiple different types or questions, and other elements like headings, text paragraphs, and dividers. Once their survey
is created, the user can export the HTML for their form for use in their website or landing pages.

## To Use

To use the survey tool, start by clicking the 'Create New Survey' button. You can adjust survey-wide settings by clicking the settings
gear next to your survey in the list on the left hand side. Select your survey and then you can drag in different types of questions and
elements to build out your survey. Click on the settings gear next to each question or element to adjust styling for each part of your 
survey. When you are finished building your survey, export the HTML for your survey by presssing the 'Export HTML' button under the 
editor.
